          <p><strong> I instil in my
            students</strong>: How to sight read, technique of the instruments, theory,
            compositions, improvisation, memorization and ear training.
            My favorite part of teaching is exposing students to what they want to learn
            , music they enjoy and the various types of music. This part year in
             November...my students played at Ketchum Burrito with spicy Latin numbers
            and in December played for Jingle at Java for Chirstmas. I wrote
            an album, called "Where the Heart Sets Free", all violin parts
            written by me this can be access at this website:<a href = "https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/melaniekerbs">
            "cdbayby.com"</a> for download or preview all song.

          <h3>My Bio</h3>
          <p>I started Violin at age 5, as question was asked by my mother,
              "What instrument what you like to learn to play"?<br> My brother
               Darren is a gifted leader and entertainer was also asked the question,
               and he said "Piano". We still play our instruments together after
               many years of taking our instruments seriously. Recently,
               Writting and composition didn't start until around 1992.
               I choose the violin because of the tenderness and exagerrations it could
               compose with its bow. I started with <a href ="http://idahosuzuki.org/">suzuki approach</a>
               about method in Nampa, Idaho. And proceeded to take from Julienne slaughter of Twill
               Falls, Idaho until I was 17. During my later years of high school and beginning of
               college I took from <a href = "http://telfordviolins.com/">Leah Telford of Boise</a>.
               I played Violin for MV Symphony, Diletannes, jump company and church growing up.
               I attended linfield college, 1992-1993 and took from Aida Baker, of Moscow, Russia.
               Theory with Daniel Bukvich and violin with Robert Billups, of University of Idaho 1994-1995.
               Private viola with David Johnson, college of Idaho and private violin with Craig Purdy of BSU.
               My years of teaching begin in 1993, when I was allowed to explore different schools of music concepts.
               Shelia Nelson's approach at <a href ="https://svsummersymphony.org/"> Sun Valley Summer Symphony</a>, workshop or teachers
               and the Suzuki approach both allowed me to receive college credits.
               On Piano, I studied in high shcool with Georgia Blastock, of filer, Idaho and Barbara Mix,
               of Twill Falls and Jodi Hardman, Hagerman, Idaho.
               Guitar, I learned from Ken Reynolds, of music center, fantastic teacher! and investigated Ukelele myself.
