          <p><strong> I instil in my students</strong>: How to sight read,
            theory, technique of the instruments,
            compositions, improvisation, memorization and ear training.<br><br>
            My favorite part of teaching is exposing students to what they want to learn,
             music they enjoy and the various types of music.<br><br> I also wrote
            an album, called <strong> "Where The Heart Sets Free"</strong>, all violin parts
            written by me this can be access at this website:<a href = "https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/melaniekerbs">
            "cdbaby.com"</a> to download or preview all song.

          <h3>My Bio</h3>
          <p>I started violin at age five, as a question was asked by my mother,
              "what instrument would you like to learn to play?". My brother
               Darren is a gifted leader and entertainer was also asked the question,
               and he said, "piano".<br> I went to a Japanese Suzuki and talent show with violins and told
               my mom, "it's violin". We still play our instruments together after
               many years of taking our instruments seriously.<br><br> Recently,
               writting and composition didn't start until around 1992...<br><br>
               I chose the violin, because of the tenderness and exagerrations it could
               compose with its bow. I started with <a href ="http://idahosuzuki.org/">Suzuki approach method</a>
                in Nampa, Idaho, and proceeded to take from Julienne Slaughter of Twin
               Falls, Idaho, until I was 17. During my latter years of high school and beginning of
               college I took from <a href = "http://telfordviolins.com/">Leah Telford of Boise.com</a>.<br><br>
               I played violin for MV Symphony, Diletannes, Jump Company and church growing up.<br><br>
               I attended Linfield College, 1992-1993 and took from Aida Baker, of Moscow, Russia.
               Theory with Daniel Bukvich and violin with Robert Billups, of University of Idaho 1994-1995,
               private viola with David Johnson, College of Idaho and private violin with Craig Purdy of BSU.<br><br>
               My years of teaching began in 1993, when I was allowed to explore different schools of music concepts.<br><br>This past year in
               November my students played at Ketchum Burrito with spicy Latin numbers
              and in December played for Jingle at Java for Chirstmas.<br><br>
               Shelia Nelson's approach at <a href ="https://svsummersymphony.org/"> Sun Valley Summer Symphony</a>, workshops or teachers
               and the Suzuki approach both allowed me to receive college credits.<br><br>
               On Piano, I studied in high school with Georgia Blastock, of Filer, Idaho, and Barbara Mix,
               of Twin Falls, and Jodi Hardman, Hagerman, Idaho. I also took counting lessons from Ted Hadley and voice from Bill Sweet.
               <br><br>Guitar I learned from Ken Reynolds, of Music Center, fantastic teacher! And investigated Ukulele myself.
